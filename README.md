# Detecting-Workplace-Burnout-from-Glassdoor-Reviews-Using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning.
Review Analytics & amp; NLP Project applies Natural Language Processing and machine learning to analyze large-scale textual reviews. Using raw data (all_reviews) and a cleaned dataset (cleaned_reviews_final), the project performs text preprocessing, feature engineering, and analytical modeling to extract meaningful insights.

# 🧠 Review Analytics & NLP Project  
*Text Mining, NLP, and Insight Extraction from User Reviews*

---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing large-scale textual review data using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Data Analytics** techniques.  
The workflow begins with raw review data (`all_reviews`) and progresses through cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to create a refined dataset (`cleaned_reviews_final`) suitable for analytical modeling.

The project demonstrates practical experience in **text preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and NLP-based insight generation** using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Used `all_reviews` as the raw input dataset containing unstructured text reviews

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed noise such as punctuation, special characters, and stopwords
- Converted text to lowercase and standardized formats
- Generated the cleaned dataset as `cleaned_reviews_final.`

### 3. NLP Processing
- Tokenization and text normalization
- Feature extraction suitable for analytical modeling
- Prepared text for downstream analysis and interpretation

### 4. Analysis & Insights
- Identified recurring themes and patterns in reviews
- Derived meaningful insights from processed text data
- Supported findings with structured analysis
